# Dynamic Pricing Model for E-Commerce with Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **dynamic pricing model** using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, specifically **Q-learning**, to optimize pricing strategies for e-commerce platforms. By adjusting prices based on factors like customer demand, competitor pricing, and other market variables, the model aims to maximize revenue through continual learning.

The goal is to train a model that dynamically adjusts prices based on historical and environmental data, helping businesses optimize their pricing strategies for higher revenue.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling to prepare raw data for modeling.
- **Reinforcement Learning Model:** Uses **Q-learning** to determine the optimal price for each situation based on market conditions.
- **Evaluation:** Compares the performance of RL-based pricing strategies with fixed pricing methods by tracking the generated revenue.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project simulates a ride-hailing scenario and contains the following features:
- `Number_of_Riders`: Number of riders requesting rides.
- `Number_of_Drivers`: Number of available drivers in the area.
- `Location_Category`: Location type (Urban, Suburban, Rural).
- `Customer_Loyalty_Status`: Customer loyalty category (Silver, Regular).
- `Number_of_Past_Rides`: Number of rides taken by the customer.
- `Average_Ratings`: Average rating of the customer.
- `Time_of_Booking`: Time of day when the booking was made (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).
- `Vehicle_Type`: Type of vehicle requested (Economy, Premium).
- `Expected_Ride_Duration`: Estimated ride time (in minutes).
- `Historical_Cost_of_Ride`: Previous cost for the ride.

### Handling Missing Data:
- **Numerical Columns:** Filled with the mean of the respective columns.
- **Categorical Columns:** Filled with the mode (most frequent value).

3. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the model by calculating the total revenue and comparing the RL-based pricing with fixed pricing strategies:

bash
Copy
Edit
python evaluation.py
Evaluation & Results
The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated by tracking total revenue over multiple episodes. As the model learns optimal pricing strategies, the revenue increases, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Example output:

Episode 0, Total Revenue: $63,388
Episode 100, Total Revenue: $70,617
Conclusion
This project effectively demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be used to create a dynamic pricing model that optimizes revenue over time. The model adjusts pricing strategies based on market conditions, showing improvement as it learns from the environment.
